# 📸 Setup Your Profile Images

## Quick Steps:

### 1. Save Your Images
Save the two images you uploaded to the `public/images/` folder with these exact names:

- **Image 1** (WeThinkCode thumbs up) → Save as: `profile-main.jpg`
- **Image 2** (Artistic patterned background) → Save as: `profile-artistic.jpg`

### 2. Location
```
/home/siyanda/cool-portfolio-web/public/images/
```

### 3. How to Save:
You can drag and drop the images directly into the `public/images/` folder in your file explorer, or use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the images folder
cd /home/siyanda/cool-portfolio-web/public/images/

# Then copy your downloaded images here and rename them to:
# - profile-main.jpg
# - profile-artistic.jpg
```

### 4. Where They Appear:
- ✨ **profile-main.jpg** - Hero section (main landing page with your name)
- 🎨 **profile-artistic.jpg** - About section on mobile (adds creative flair)

### 5. Fallback:
If images don't load, a stylish placeholder will show automatically with your initials.
